# COVID-19 mitigation policies project

This is a repository made to explore existent Agent Based Modeling tools that could be used in the project "Studying the impacts of COVID-19 mitigation policies on health outcomes: A simulation modelling approach".

We have summarised our thoughts and impression in our [review of the toolings](https://github.com/covid19ABM/abm_tool_exploration/blob/main/review_tooling_options.md).
